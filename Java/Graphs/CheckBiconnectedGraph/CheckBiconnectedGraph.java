// Check if the given graph is a Biconnected Graph

// Biconnected Graph is one which is an INSEPARABLE Graph, meaning that if any
// one vertex were to be removed, the graph will still remain connected.
// On removal, the number of components remain the same in a biconnected graph

// Any vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components
// violates the property of biconnectedness.
// All such vertices are called Articulation Vertices or Cut-Vertices.
// i.e. A cutpoint, cut vertex, or articulation point of a graph G is a
// vertex that is shared by two or more connected blocks.

// For this to be true, there should be two vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices.
// In a Biconnected Graph, there is a simple cycle through any two vertices.

// A connected graph is Biconnected if it is connected and doesnâ€™t have any
// Articulation Point. We mainly need to check two things in a graph.
// a) The graph is connected.
// b) There is not articulation point in graph.

// The idea is to run a DSF while maintaining the following information:
// a) the depth of each vertex in the DFS tree (once it gets visited), and
// b) for each vertex v, the lowest depth of neighbors of all descendants of v
//    (including v itself) in the DFS tree, called the lowpoint.

// The lowpoint of v can be computed after visiting all descendants of v
// (i.e., just before v gets popped off the DFS stack) as the minimum of the
// b.1 depth of v,
// b.2 depth of all neighbors of v (other than the parent of v in the DFS tree)
// b.3 lowpoint of all children of v in the depth-first-search tree.

// Applications: This property is especially useful in maintaining a graph with
//               a two-fold redundancy, to prevent disconnection upon the
//               removal of a single edge (or connection). Hence, it usefull in
//               the field of networking.

// Time Complexity: O(V+E) because of DFS, graph represented by adjascency lists
